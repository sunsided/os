# Developer Diary

I have started wrapping my head around the Virtual Memory Manager.

I also learned about the `-monitor stdio` QEMU option as well as the `-debugcon file:debug.log`
variant.

Adding a serial output to the QEMU emulator turned out to be extremely helpful in finding out
what was going on when my UEFI loader would simply spin indefinitely and then get killed by QEMU
after some 60 seconds. It turned out that the calling convention was problematic: having my
Kernel `_start_kernel` as `extern "C"` (assuming the first argument, the `KernelBootInfo` struct
would be passed in `rdi`) was a bad idea: The UEFI code is PE/COFF and used `win64` calling conventions,
setting up the argument in `rcx` instead. Changing calling conventions a bit and setting up a naked
jump pad in `_start_kernel` fixed the problem.

I then added a bit of RSDP/XSDP, i.e. ACPI 1.0 and 2.0 parsing, only to later on learn that QEMU
currently does not even support ACPI 2.0.
